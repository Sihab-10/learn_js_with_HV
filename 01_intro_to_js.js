-> Functions returning Functions

=====================================Very Important Array Methods=======================

-> Foreach method

-> Reduce

-> Sort

-> Find

-> Every 

-> Some

-> Fill method 

-> Splice method

======================================More useful things================================

-> iterables

-> Sets

-> Maps

-> Object.assign

-> Optional chaining

============================Object Oriented JavaScript, Prototypal Inheritance===========

-> Methods

-> This keyword, window object

-> Call, apply and bind method

-> some warnings

-> This inside arrow functions

-> Short syntax for methods

-> Factory functions & discuss some memory related problems

-> First solution to that problem

-> Why that solution isn't that great

-> What is __proto__, [[prototype]]

-> What is prototype

-> Use prototype

-> New Keyword

-> Constructor function with new keyword

-> More discussion about proto and prototype

-> Class Keyword

-> Examples using class keyword

-> Super keyword

-> Method overriding

-> Getters and setters

-> Static methods and properties

====================================How JavaScript Works===============================

-> Global Execution context

-> This and window in global execution context

-> Hoisting

-> Are let and const are hoisted ? What is reference error?

-> Function execution context

-> Scope chain and lexical environment

-> Intro to closures

-> Closure examples 1

-> Closure examples 2

-> Closure examples 3

================================DOM Tutorial========================================

-> HTML and CSS practice (Around 30-40 minutes)

-> Async vs defer

-> Select Elements using id

-> querySelector 

-> textContent & innerText

-> Change the style of elements using js

-> Get and set attributes

-> Select multiple elements and loop through them 

-> innerHTML

-> Deeply understand dom tree, root node, element nodes, text nodes

-> classList

-> Add new elements to page

-> Create elements 

-> Insert adjacent elements

-> Clone nodes

-> More methods to add elements on page

-> How to get the dimensions of the element

Asynchronous JavaScript
-> Is Javascript a synchronous or asynchronous programming language ? 
-> SetTimeout()
-> SetTimeout() with 0 millisecond
-> Callback Queue
-> SetInterval and create little project with setInterval
-> Understand callbacks in general
-> Callbacks in asynchronous programming 
-> Callback Hell and Pyramid of dom

Promises, network request
-> Intro to promises
-> Microtask Queue
-> Function that returns promise
-> Promise and settimeout
-> Promise.resolve and more about then method
-> Convert nested Callbacks to flat code using promises
-> Intro to Ajax, HTTP Request
-> XHR requests
-> Error handling in XHR requests
-> XHR request Chaining 
-> Promisifying XHR requests and chaining using then method
-> Fetch API
-> Error Handling in Fetch API
-> Consume Promises with async and Await

ES6 (ES2015) Modules

Split code into multiple files using ES6 modules.

Congratulations 
Now you know javascript in Great Details
What next ?

History of JavaScript

-> ECMAScript
-> JavaScript
-> ES5
-> ES6
-> ES7
-> ES2015
-> ES2016
-> ES2017
-> ES2018

-----------------------------------------------------------

In 1995 -> Netscape Navigator (Popular Web Browser) -> Brendan Eich (he works for them) (He creates javaScript withing 10 days) ->
javaScript first name was Mocha -> then its name changed with LiveScript --> then its name changed with name of a popular programming language java and finally they named the language is javaScript
Mocha --> LiveScript --> JavaScript

Internet Explorer use some javascript code and create a jscript language 

So in 1996 there are two browser who use two different languages in their browser. 

So then comes ECMAScript who solve this issue. ECMAScript (International Standardization ) makes a standard language for all the browsers 

ES1: 1997

ES2
ES3 
.
.
ES5: 2009 (lots of new features)
ES6: 2015 (Biggest update in the history of js) --> Modern JavaScript
ES7: ES2016
ES8: ES2017
TC39 --> Technical Community 39 --> They came with new features every year 

to comewith great features in javaScript there are 4 stages to follow 

*** JavaScript is backward compatible language***
Meaning যেই features javaScript এ ১০ বছর আগে আসছিল সেটা এখনো কাজ করবে 
কিন্তু *** javaScript is not forward compatibel language 
Meaning ধরা যাক আজকে একটি javaScript এর নতুন features আসলো এখন আমরা যদি আমাদের browser update না করি তাহলে সেটি কাজ করবে না ।
