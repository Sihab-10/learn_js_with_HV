// what topic we practice in this js mastery journey

/*
====================================Basic of Programming in JavaScript====================

-> Hello world program

-> Declare variable using var

-> More about variable

-> Let 

-> Const

-> String Indexing

-> Useful string methods

-> Template strings

-> Null, undefined, Bigint, typeof

-> Truthy and falsy values

-> If else statement

-> Ternary Operator

-> If else statement

-> Ternary Operator

-> && || operator

-> Nested if else

-> if elseif else

-> Switch statement

-> While loop 

-> While loop examples

-> For loop

-> For loop examples

-> Break and continue keyword

-> Do while loop

========================================Arrays in JavaScript===============================

-> Intro to arrays

-> Push pop shift unshift

-> Primitive vs reference data types

-> Clone array & spread operator

-> For loop

-> use const for creating arrays

-> While loop in array

-> for of loop 

-> for in loop 

-> Array destructuring

==================================Functions in JavaScript===============================
-> Function declaration

-> Function Expression

-> Arrow Function

-> Function declarations are hoisted (covered in great detail, later in the course)

-> Function inside function

-> Lexical Scope

-> Block Scope Vs Function Scope

-> Default Parameters

-> Parameter Destructing

-> Very brief intro to callback functions(covered in great detail, later in the course)

-> Functions returning Functions

=====================================Very Important Array Methods=======================

-> Foreach method

-> Map method

-> Filter

-> Reduce

-> Sort

-> Find

-> Every 

-> Some

-> Fill method 

-> Splice method

======================================More useful things================================

-> iterables

-> Sets

-> Maps

-> Object.assign

-> Optional chaining

============================Object Oriented JavaScript, Prototypal Inheritance===========

-> Methods

-> This keyword, window object

-> Call, apply and bind method

-> some warnings

-> This inside arrow functions

-> Short syntax for methods

-> Factory functions & discuss some memory related problems

-> First solution to that problem

-> Why that solution isn't that great

-> What is __proto__, [[prototype]]

-> What is prototype

-> Use prototype

-> New Keyword

-> Constructor function with new keyword

-> More discussion about proto and prototype

-> Class Keyword

-> Examples using class keyword

-> Super keyword

-> Method overriding

-> Getters and setters

-> Static methods and properties

====================================How JavaScript Works===============================

-> Global Execution context

-> This and window in global execution context

-> Hoisting

-> Are let and const are hoisted ? What is reference error?

-> Function execution context

-> Scope chain and lexical environment

-> Intro to closures

-> Closure examples 1

-> Closure examples 2

-> Closure examples 3

================================DOM Tutorial========================================

-> HTML and CSS practice (Around 30-40 minutes)

-> Async vs defer

-> Select Elements using id

-> querySelector 

-> textContent & innerText

-> Change the style of elements using js

-> Get and set attributes

-> Select multiple elements and loop through them 

-> innerHTML

-> Deeply understand dom tree, root node, element nodes, text nodes

-> classList

-> Add new elements to page

-> Create elements 

-> Insert adjacent elements

-> Clone nodes

-> More methods to add elements on page

-> How to get the dimensions of the element


=================================Intro to closures==================================
-> Closure example 1
-> Closure Example 2
-> Closure Example 3

=====================================DOM Tutorial=====================================

-> HTML and CSS Crash course ( Around 30-40 minutes)

Events
-> Intro to events
-> This keyword inside eventListener callback
-> Add events on multiple elements
-> Event object
-> How event listener works
-> Practice with events
-> Create demo project
-> More events
-> Event bubbling
-> Event Capturing
-> Event delegation 
-> Create Project using event delegation

Asynchronous JavaScript
-> Is Javascript a synchronous or asynchronous programming language ? 
-> SetTimeout()
-> SetTimeout() with 0 millisecond
-> Callback Queue
-> SetInterval and create little project with setInterval
-> Understand callbacks in general
-> Callbacks in asynchronous programming 
-> Callback Hell and Pyramid of dom

Promises, network request
-> Intro to promises
-> Microtask Queue
-> Function that returns promise
-> Promise and settimeout
-> Promise.resolve and more about then method
-> Convert nested Callbacks to flat code using promises
-> Intro to Ajax, HTTP Request
-> XHR requests
-> Error handling in XHR requests
-> XHR request Chaining 
-> Promisifying XHR requests and chaining using then method
-> Fetch API
-> Error Handling in Fetch API
-> Consume Promises with async and Await

ES6 (ES2015) Modules

Split code into multiple files using ES6 modules.

Congratulations 
Now you know javascript in Great Details
What next ?
